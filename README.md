TEC-1 Neural Network

"neural networks, are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain."
"In the case of recognizing handwriting or facial recognition, the brain very quickly makes some decisions."
"There are several kinds of artificial neural networks. These types of networks are implemented based on the mathematical operations and a set of parameters required to determine the output."

### 20 neural network types
