TEC-1 Neural Network

"neural networks, are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain."
"In the case of recognizing handwriting or facial recognition, the brain very quickly makes some decisions."
"There are several kinds of artificial neural networks. These types of networks are implemented based on the mathematical operations and a set of parameters required to determine the output."

### 20 neural network types

1. Feedforward neural network, uses perceptron algorithm 
2. Convolutional neural network, uses deep learning algorithm
3. Recurrent neural network, "are the state of the art algorithm for sequential data and are used by Apple's Siri and and Google's voice search. It is the first algorithm that remembers its input, due to an internal memory, which makes it perfectly suited for machine learning problems that involve sequential data."
4. Long short-term memory, "are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. This is a behavior required in complex problem domains like machine translation, speech recognition, and more. LSTMs are a complex area of deep learning."
5. Gated recurrent unit, "are a gating mechanism in recurrent neural networks, use connections through a sequence of nodes to perform machine learning tasks associated with memory and clustering, for instance, in speech recognition."
6. Echo state network, "is a type of reservoir computer that uses a recurrent neural network with a sparsely connected hidden layer (with typically 1% connectivity). The connectivity and weights of hidden neurons are fixed and randomly assigned. The weights of output neurons can be learned so that the network can produce or reproduce specific temporal patterns." see https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-BRAIN
7. Self-organizing map, "is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to produce a low-dimensional representation of a higher dimensional data set while preserving the topological structure of the data."
8. Neural Turing machine
9. Deep belief network
10. Stacked autoencoder
11. Generative adversarial network
12. Siamese network
13. Highway network
14. Dropout
15. Perceptron
16. Multilayer perceptron
17. Radial basis function network
18. Support vector machine
19. Max-pooling
20. Average-pooling
